# NmapExcelPort
This is a program set that uses libnmap, openpyxl, and manuf to run an nmap scan then export it to an Excel Document with decent formatting.
Manuf: https://github.com/coolbho3k/manuf
libnmap: can be installed using PIP
openpyxl: can be installed using PIP

This is written for using an internal scan to do an asset inventory of the network connected devices, the next file I put up will be for the periodic scans.
